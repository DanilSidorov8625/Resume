# Danil Sidorov - Resume

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my professional resume. I maintain this as a living document to track my experience, projects, and skills as I grow as a software developer.

You can view the most up-to-date version of my resume here:

### Repo Structure

* `resume.tex`: The primary LaTeX file containing the resume content and formatting.
* `resume.pdf`: The compiled PDF version of the resume.

### How It's Built

This resume is crafted with **LaTeX**, a powerful document preparation system. I chose LaTeX for its professional typography, precise control over formatting, and ability to generate a clean, elegant PDF.
